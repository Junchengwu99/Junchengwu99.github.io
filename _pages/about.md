I am currently a lecturer in the Department of Advertising, Communication University of China. I received my Ph.D. in communication and My primary research interest is in social neuroscience, especially brain synchronization in social contexts. Before receiving my Ph.D., I worked in [Neurosciense of Message Lab](https://nomcomm.github.io/) and [CarismaLab](https://www.carismalab.com/). In my spare time, I enjoy kayaking, paddling (though still poor), and spending time with my cat Tuantuan.
