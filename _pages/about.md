I am currently a lecturer in the Department of Advertising, Communication University of China. I received my Ph.D. in communication and currently my research focuses on social neuroscience, psychophysiological measurements, and audience response measurement. Before receiving my Ph.D., I worked in [Neurosciense of Message Lab](https://nomcomm.github.io/) and [CarismaLab](https://www.carismalab.com/).
